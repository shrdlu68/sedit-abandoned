This was meant to be a TUI tool with which you one could configure/manage an
SElinux system. I abandoned it due to lack of documentation for libsemanage,
and sources from which I could glean usage information.
Newt is a simplistic TUI library, but with some cleverness one could use it
to build sophisticated functionality.
